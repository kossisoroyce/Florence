# Florence
Florence is an interactive AI character modelling language. 
Plain text for AI character modelsâ€”it's the go-to for many developers, despite it often leaving AI as confused as ever about the intended nuances. That's where this markup language comes in! It's designed to add much-needed precision to ensure that AI assistants capture the exact context and details we envision.
With the Lady Florence CML, we can build AI Model Characters with precision, which is a step towards smarter, more accurate AI interactions.
For this model to become control-level accurate, we must create a repository of attributes. This is possible via Github. This repository will act as our model dictionary. 

Florence is an environmentless language meaning that it doesn't require any prerequisites. Its core tags were mirrored from the core pillars of human psychology. To be dramatic, the language attempts to make AI Characters in the image of man.
