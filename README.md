# Florence
Florence is an interactive AI character modelling language. 
Plain text for AI character modelsâ€”it's the go-to for many developers, despite it often leaving AI as confused as ever about the intended nuances. That's where this markup language comes in! It's designed to add much-needed precision to ensure that AI assistants capture the exact context and details we envision.
With the Lady Florence CML, we can build AI Model Characters with precision, which is a step towards smarter, more accurate AI interactions.
For this model to become control-level accurate, we must create a repository of attributes. This is possible via Github. This repository will act as our model dictionary. 

Florence is an environmentless language meaning that it doesn't require any prerequisites. Its core tags were mirrored from the core pillars of human psychology. To be dramatic, the language attempts to make AI Characters in the image of man. 


<h2>Structure & Syntax</h2>
<b>Tags:</b> Similar to HTML, you can use opening and closing tags to define sections.

<b>Attributes:</b> Use attributes within tags to specify additional information, like <tone type="witty"> to indicate tone.

<b>Nesting:</b> Allow tags to be nested for complex character definitions, ensuring logical grouping and hierarchy.

<h3>dictionary</h3>
A dictionary serves as a repository for the definitions of our attributes. For a broad stroke approach, we can set the model to browse the web and learn {this approach is not advised}.
Each character should have its dictionary. This is to modulate responses for extreme control levels.<b>[extreme control levels should be used for products serving children and young adults]</b>

<b>How to call the dictionary</b> 
To call the dictionary, you can use advanced functions like web_search="google.com" or call_home="URL to the dictionary on GitHub" 

To define an attribute from a repository, attach "call_home" as a class. eg ```<relationship type="friend" Parameter_call_home=" best-friend">```
